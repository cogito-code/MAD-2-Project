While working on these tutorials, I found myself staring at a blank screen for quite a while, trying to figure out where to start and how to move forward. I kept looking at the reflection of the sky on the tinted window in front of me, but still couldn’t decide how to begin. I think all of us have faced this kind of moment at some point in our lives. It’s a similar feeling when we read the problem statement given by the course instructors—we might have lots of ideas but no clear starting point. In these tutorials, I’ll try to help you get started with the project.

Let's start with the first few set of videos, where we will be setting up the backend of our application. 

I’ll be taking quite a few detours along the way so that the concepts are easier for you to understand. I might not go into every single detail, but I’ll do my best to help you build the confidence to move forward with the project and learn how to explore concepts through documentation and other resources. These days, we have access to powerful large language models that can quickly give us code snippets. I’d suggest that even if you’re using these tools, try asking for different examples and take the time to understand how the code actually works under the hood. That understanding will really help you when you're working on your own projects in the future.

Let's start with the first few set of videos, where we will be setting up the backend of our application.

1. [Understanding ande creating APIs]() - In this video, we will be creating a simple API using Flask. We will also learn how to use Thunder Client to test our API. Code used in this video is accessible in the file named `flask_apis.py`.
